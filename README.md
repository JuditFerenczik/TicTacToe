TicTacToe C# version


A simple C# console Tictactoe game. It is played on a 3X3 matrix. Each round it asks you which spot you want to cross from 1-9 starting with the top left corner.
It writes X or O according to which symbol you are with. If someone has 3 symbols in a row, in a column or in diagonally that person wins.
In each round it checks whether someone won or not. If yes then the game ends.
If no one wins until all the grids are covered with X or O then the game ends with a tie.
